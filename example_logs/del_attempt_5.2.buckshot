phase I, 2 charges

round I.1
dealer gets phone, cuffs
dealer loads 2 live, 4 blank
player shoots dealer, blank
!check shells = 2 live, 3 blank

# dealer knows there's a 2/5 (40%) chance for the next shell to be live, so they would want to shoot themself for a chance at another turn
# shell possibilities: llbbb llbbb llbbb llbbb llbbb

dealer uses phone
dealer uses cuffs

# suppose they learn that the third shell is live:
    # shell possibilities: lbbb lbbb l lbbb lbbb
    # then there's a 1/4 (25%) chance for the next shell to be live
# suppose they learn that the third shell is blank
    # shell possibilities: llbb llbb b llbb llbb
    # then there's a 1/2 (50%) chance for the next shell to be live
# so if the dealer happens to choose to shoot the player on the 50% chance that they get another turn, this would be evidence that they heard that the third shell is blank
# (of course, if the dealer is aware of this strategy, since the odds are even, they'll choose the option that's the same as before so that they give no information)

dealer shoots player, blank

!check shells = 2 live, 2 blank
# without DEL, the player would think that each of the four shells has a 50% probability of being live
    # shell possibilities: llbb llbb llbb llbb
# but with DEL, the player thinks the next is 67% live, then 100% blank, then 67% live, then 67% live
    # shell possibilities: llb b llb llb

dealer shoots player, live
!check player charges = 1

!check shells = 1 live, 2 blank

# without DEL, the player would think that each of the three shells has a 33% chance of being live
# shell possibilities: lbb lbb lbb
# if the player shoots themself:
    # if live (33%), they lose
    # if blank (67%):
        # shell possibilities: lb lb
        # if player shoots themself:
            # if live (50%), player loses
            # if blank (50%), next shell is live, player shoots dealer, continue to next round
        # if player shoots dealer:
            # if live (50%), player damages dealer, the next shell is blank, continue to next round
            # if blank (50%), the next shell is live, dealer shoots player, player loses
    # so:
    #  33% + (50% * 67%) = 66% that player loses
    #  (50% * 67%) = 33% dealer takes one damage, continue to next round
# if the player shoots the dealer:
    # if live (33%), player damages dealer, the rest are blanks, continue to next round
    # if blank (67%):
        # shell possibilities: lb lb
        # if dealer shoots themself:
            # if live (50%), they damage themself, next shell is blank, continue to next round
            # if blank (50%), the next is live, dealer shoots player, player loses
        # if dealer shoots player:
            # if live (50%), player loses
            # if blank (50%), the next is live, player shoots dealer, continue to next round
    # so:
    #  67% * 50% = 33% that player loses
    #  33% + (50% * 67%) = 67% that dealer takes one damage, continue to next round
# so player should shoot the dealer

# but with DEL, the player thinks the next is 100% blank, then 50% live, then 50% live
# shell possibilities: b lb lb
# if player shoots themself, it's blank, then
    # if the player shoots themself:
        # if live (50%), player loses
        # if blank (50%), the next is live, player shoots dealer, dealer takes one damage, continue to next round
    # if the player shoots the dealer:
        # if live (50%), dealer takes one damage, last round is blank, continue to next round
        # if blank (50%), next round is live, dealer shoots player, player loses
# if the player shoots the dealer, it's blank, then
    # if the dealer shoots the player:
        # if live (50%), player loses
        # if blank (50%), next is live, player shoots dealer, dealer takes one damage, continue to next round
    # if the dealer shoots themself
        # if live (50%), dealer takes one damage, next is blank, continue to next round
        # if blank (50%), next is live, dealer shoots player, player loses
# so:
    # 50% that player loses
    # 50% that dealer takes one damage, continue to next round

# if reasoning without DEL, we choose to shoot the dealer, expecting 67% survival chance
# but if reasoning with DEL, we can choose whichever, expecting 50% survival chance
